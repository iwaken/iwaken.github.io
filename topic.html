    <dl><dt>Curry Rice</dt>
  <dd>What type of curry rice do you like?<br>
      Especialy Very hot and spicy.<br>
      What type of topping do you liek? <br>
      I love a Fried pork.Fried pork and curry are very good colaboration.<br>
      And a row egg is also good! in this case,I'll mix row eggs and curry.<br>
      After that the curry rice will change to more mild taste.<br>
     What kind of place do you want to eat it?<br>
      Out side in summer camps.Some times we cook curry in camps, and then the simple curry is very good!<br>
      We cook much curry by ourselves and eat with many friends. 
      So maybe it seems to be more delicious by synergistic effect.
