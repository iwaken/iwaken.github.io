      <dl><dt>Curry Rice</dt><br><br>
  <dd>What type of curry rice do you like?<br> 
      I liek very hot and spicy one. I'm interested in trying a very, very hot curry in curry restaurants.<br> 
      Although I sweat a lot, I feel so good.But one time, the curry which I oredered was too hot for me to eat half as much.<br><br>
      
      What type of topping do you like? <br>
      I love a Fried pork.Fried pork and curry are very good colaboration. And a row egg is also good! <br>
      Then I'll mix row eggs and curry. After that the curry rice will change to more mild taste.<br><br>
      
      Sometimes I cook curry by myself in my home.<br> 
      It is easy by using commercially available curry roux.<br>
      But I always have to eat the curry for a few days because of cooking too much curry.<br>
        </dd><hr>
     
         <dt>Ramen</dt><br><br>
        <dd>What type of Ramen do you like?<br>
            I like a beef taste noodle. We call it a cow bone ramen.<br>
        This type noodle is very rare. Generally it is popular to use pork, chiken, fish and vesitables. <br><br>
           
            How situation do you eat a Ramen?<br>
            After drinking, sometimes I go to a ramen restaurant.<br> 
            Then I feel more dericious because I am drunk.<br>
            Off course, I will oreder beer too.<br><br>
       
            Sometimes I cook an instant ramen by myself.<br> 
            Then I put in an egg and been sprouts becouse of changing more helthy food.<br>

      <dt>Cheese</dt><br><br>
        <dd> What kinds of cheese?<br>
        Especially I like Blue chiese.<br>
        In our community, chiese is a little expensive.So we can not eat blue chiese a lot.<br><br>
        One time, when we were drinking, we ordered a lot of blue chiese.<br> 
        Then the cheese was left,so one girl took out the left blue cheese in her bag.<br>
        But after that the bag had kept a hard smell of blue chiese.<br><br>
            when we went skiing, we rested in a small hut on the mountainside.<br>
            Then we had cheese fondue with beer.<br>
           The mountain hut was warm with the fireplace, and the coziness was very good.<br>
           It is one of very good memories for me.<br>

        <dt> Steak & Yakiniku</dt>
         <dd> I like steak. Sometimes I go to a ateak restraunt and order one pond or more steak with beer.<br> 
             Recently standing style steak house is popular.<br>
           Basically that restaurant has no seats. It is no probem for me.<br> 
             So I have visited that restaurant at several times .</dd><hr><br><br>
          

          <dd>About once a month, I will go to a grilled meat shop.<br> 
              At that time, first I will order Calbi, Beef Tongue, Kimchi, Hormone, and Beer.<br>
              Sometimes I'll treat my junior Yakiniku.<br>
              Definitly Yakiniku is very dericious but after that I'll care of smell a little.</dd><hr>
              
              <dt>Sushi</dt>
             <dd> I often go casual sushi restaurants. I am satisfied with this sushi sufficiently.<br>
              Sometimes I visite classical style sushi restaurant too.<br>
              I feel so good both styles restaurants.</dd> <hr>

          <dt>Coffee</dt>
         <dd>I love coffee. I often visite at a cafe with my favorite books.<br> 
             Sometimes before visiting a cafe,I have already drunk a beer.<br>
             I like to read books at a cafe. So I usually stay at a cafe more than 3hours.<br> 
             In the cafe, there are many custmers talking about various topics.<br>
             But I do not care about their speech. Rather it feels even at comfortable BGM.<br><br>
             I don't smoke but I drink the vending machine coffee many times a day during work.</dd><hr>
          
          <dt>Beer</dt><br><br> 
        <dd>What type of beer do you like?<br><br>
        I love a simple and clear taste beer, and I hope beer is cold and chilled.<br>
            Then it should be freezed the cup too.<br>
            sometimes I drink a dark beer. The biter taste is good!<br><br>
            When do you drink beer?<br>
            Basically after working, I drink beer in my home or bars.<br><br>
            How do you feel after drinking?<br>
            I feel so good! When I’ｍ in a very good condition, I sing songs in front of people.<br>
            I like Karaoki with alchole.</dd><hr>
           <dt>Supplemental topics.MRI</dt><br><br> 
         <dd> MRI is an abbreviation for magnetic, resonance, imaging.It is an indispensable medical device in current medical care.<br>
           The biggest merit of MRI is that it does not irradiate like CT or x-rays. <br>
             But when we enter the MRI room we have to be very cautious because MRI utilizes a very strong magnetic force.<br>
