     <dl><dt>Curry Rice</dt><br><br>
  <dd>What type of curry rice do you like?<br><br> 
      Especialy very hot and spicy. I'm interested in trying a very, very hot curry in curry restaurants.<br> 
      Although I sweat a lot, I feel so good.But one time, the curry which I oredered was too hot for me to eat half as much.<br><br>
      What type of topping do you like? <br><br>
      I love a Fried pork.Fried pork and curry are very good colaboration. And a row egg is also good! Then I'll mix row eggs and curry.<br>
      After that the curry rice will change to more mild taste.<br>
      <br>
     What kind of place do you want to eat it?<br><br>
      In summer camps.Some times we cook curry in camps, and then the simple taste curry is very good!<br>
      We cook much curry by ourselves and eat with many friends. 
      So maybe it seems to be more delicious by synergistic effect.<br><br>
      Can you cook curry in your home?<br><br>
      Yes, sometimes I cook curry by myself in my home. It is easy by using commercially available curry roux.

         <dt>Ramen</dt><br><br>
        <dd>What type of Ramen do you like?<br><br>
            I like a beef taste noodle. We call it a cow bone ramen.<br>
        This type noodle is very rare. Generally it is popular to use pork, chiken, fish and vesitables. <br><br>
        What type of topping do you like?<br><br>
            I like much green onions.　The compatibility of ramen and green onion is very good.　<br><br>
            How much do you like hardness of noodles?<br><br>
            I like hardened noodles, and dislike soft noodles.<br><br>
            How situation do you eat a Ramen?<br><br>
            After drinking, sometimes I go to a ramen restaurant. Then I feel more dericious because I am drunk.<br><br>
       Sometimes I cook an instant ramen by myself. Then I put in an egg and been sprouts becouse of changing more helthy food.

      <dt>Beer</dt><br><br> 
        <dd>What type of beer do you like?<br><br>
        I love a simple and clear taste beer, and I hope beer is cold and chilled.Then it should be freezed the cup too.<br>
            sometimes I drink a dark beer. The biter taste is good!<br><br>
            When do you drink beer?<br><br>
            Basically after working, I drink beer in my home or bars.<br><br>
            How do you feel after drinking?<br><br>
            I feel so good! When I’ｍ in a very good condition, I sing songs in front of people.I like Karaoke with alchole.<hr>
                  
      <dt>Chiese</dt><br><br>
        <dd> What kinds of cheiese?<br><br>
        Especially I like Blue chiese.　<br><br>
        In our community, chiese is a little expensive.So we can not eat blue chiese a lot.<br><br>
        One time, when we were drinking, we ordered a lot of blue chiese.<br> 
        Then the chiese was left,so one girl took out the left blue chiese in her bag.<br>
        But after that the bag got a hard smell of blue chiese.<br><br>
            when we went skiing, we rested in a small restaurant on the mountainside.Then we ordered cheese fondue at the resutaurant.
            That was very good! 
        </dd><br><br>
         <dt>Coffee</dt>
         <dd>I love coffee. I often visite at a cafe with my favorite books. Sometimes before visiting a cafe, I have already drunk a beer.<br>
             I like to read books at a cafe. So I usually stay at a cafe more than 3hours. In the cafe, there are many custmers talking about various topics.<br>
             But I do not care about their speech. Rather it feels even at comfortable BGM.
