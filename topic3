      <dl><dt>Curry Rice</dt>
  <dd>What type of curry rice do you like?<br> 
      I like very hot and spicy one. I'm interested in trying a very, very hot curry in restaurants.<br> 
      Although I sweat a lot, I feel so good.<br>
      But one time, the curry which I oredered was too hot for me to eat half as much.<br><br>
      
      What type of topping do you like? <br>
      I like a fried pork.Fried pork and curry are very good collaboration!
      <br><br>
      
      Sometimes I cook curry by myself in my home.<br> 
      It is easy by using commercially available curry roux.<br>
      But I always have to eat the curry for a few days because of cooking too much curry.<br>
        </dd>
     
         <dt>Ramen</dt>
        
          <dd>I like ramen. <br>
        I like to try various types of ramen at various ramen shops.<br><br>
           
            How situation do you eat a ramen?<br>
            After drinking, sometimes I go to a ramen restaurant.<br> 
            Then I feel more dericious.<br><br>
           
       
            Sometimes I cook an instant ramen by myself.<br> 
            Then I put in an egg and been sprouts becouse of changing more helthy food.<br>
         </dd>              
      <dt>Cheese</dt>
        <dd> What kinds of cheese?<br>
        Especially I like Blue cheese.<br>
        In our community, cheese is a little expensive.So we can not eat blue cheese a lot.<br><br>
        
           When we went skiing, we rested in a small hut on the mountainside.<br>
            Then we had cheese fondue with beer.<br>
           The mountain hut was warm with the fireplace, and the coziness was very good.<br>
           It is one of very good memories for me.<br>
        </dd>
        <dt> Steak & Yakiniku</dt>
         <dd> I like steak.<br> 
             Sometimes I go to a casual steak restraunt and order one pond or more steak with beer.<br>
             Beef steak is very dericous!
             <br><br> 
            
            
          

          About once every few months, I will go to a yakiniku restaurant.<br> 
              At that time, first I will order Calbi, Beef Tongue, Kimchi, Hormone, and Beer.<br>
              
              Yakiniku is dericious. It is very fun to eat yakiniku with a lot of friends.</dd>
              
              <dt>Sushi</dt>
             <dd> I often go conveyor belt sushi restaurants. I am satisfied with this sushi sufficiently.<br>
              Sometimes I visite classical style sushi restaurant too.<br>
              I feel so good for both different style restaurants. <br><br>
                 
                 I like wasabi. Definitly I need a lot of wasabi with sushi.<br>
                 And it is important to soysource taste too in the restaurant.<br>
          
          </dd> 
          <dt>Coffee</dt>
         <dd>I love coffee. I often visite at a cafe with my favorite books.<br> 
             Sometimes before visiting a cafe,I have already drunk a beer.<br>
             I like to read books at a cafe. So I usually stay at a cafe more than 3hours.<br> 
             In the cafe, there are many custmers talking about various topics.<br>
             But I do not care about their speech. Rather it feels even at comfortable BGM.<br><br>
             I don't smoke but I drink the vending machine coffee many times a day during work.</dd>
          
          <dt>Beer</dt> 
        <dd>What type of alcohol do you like?<br>
            I like beer.<br>
            What type of beer do you like?<br>
        I love a simple taste beer, and I hope beer is cold and chilled.<br><br>
             
            How do you feel after drinking?<br>
            I feel so good! When I'm in a very good condition, I sing songs in front of people.<br>

           <dt>Supplement... Medical topics about MRI and CT</dt> 
         <dd Class=medical> MRI is an abbreviation for magnetic resonance imaging.<br>
             It is an indispensable medical device in current medical care.<br>
           The biggest merit of MRI is that it does not irradiate like CT or x-rays. <br>
             But when we enter the MRI room we have to be very cautious<br>
             because MRI utilizes a very strong magnetic force.<br><br>
             
             CT is an abbrebiation for computed tomography.<br>
             CT is also an indispensable medical device in current medical care.<br>
             The biggest merit of CT is its speed.<br> 
             Recent CT can scan the entire body in about 10 seconds.<br>
             However, the disadvantage of CT is that it receives medical exposure.
