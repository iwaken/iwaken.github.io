          <dt>Coffee</dt>
         <dd>I love coffee. I often visite at a cafe with my favorite books.<br> 
             Sometimes before visiting a cafe,I have already drunk a beer.<br>
             I like to read books at a cafe. So I usually stay at a cafe more than 3hours.<br> 
             In the cafe, there are many custmers talking about various topics.<br>
             But I do not care about their speech. Rather it feels even at comfortable BGM.<br><br>
             I don't smoke but I drink the vending machine coffee many times a day during work.</dd>
          
          <dt>Beer</dt> 
        <dd>What type of alcohol do you like?<br>
            I like beer.<br>
            What type of beer do you like?<br>
        I love a simple taste beer, and I hope beer is cold and chilled.<br><br>
             
            How do you feel after drinking?<br>
            I feel so good! When I'm in a very good condition, I sing songs in front of people.<br>
